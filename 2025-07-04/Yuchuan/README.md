### What key challenges does the paper aim to address?
The paper tackles three main challenges in generating effective fake reviews for shilling: (1) Lack of supervision: Thereâ€™s no ground truth for malicious reviews, making standard supervised learning infeasible. (2) Trade-off between realism and effectiveness: Reviews must be fluent and informative enough to pass as genuine while still influencing recommendation outputs. (3)Diversity and relevance: Generated reviews must vary across similar items and contain fine-grained, aspect-based information to mimic human reviews authentically.
