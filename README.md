For every student who would like to share papers:

+ 3 min: Presentation (Slides are optional)

+ 3 min: Discussion and Q&A.

## Paper Selection

Papers should be:

+ Relevant to the groupâ€™s theme or field (LLM-based papers are preferred).

+ Peer-reviewed or top-tier preprints (e.g., arXiv, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL).

+ Papers with methods that can be generalized to a broad range of areas are preferred.

## Participation Rules

Everyone who wants to share papers should read the paper beforehand and answer the following questions.

+ Why did you choose to share this paper?

+ What is the motivation behind this paper?

+ What key challenges does the paper aim to address?

+ How do you envision applying the methods from this paper to your own research? 

+ How can the ideas in this paper be generalized to other areas or problems? 

Feel free to use LLMs to assist with summarization. However, for the last two questions, your personal insights and critical thinking are especially valued.
